# RbsUnscrambler

RbsUnscrambler is a simple script that decrypts the encrypted .rbs files usually found in Sketchup extensions. Looking at .rbs files is a great way to figure out undocumented API methods and develops SU's functionality even further. After all 'SketchUp is Undeniably Sexy'!

These files are generated by this [scrambler](http://www.sketchup.com/intl/en/developer/docs/utilities).

You 'll need the key Sketchup is using to encrypt these files, that is baked into the application.

This code is provided as is, implements a well known/public decryption scheme and is meant only as a reference. Use of this code to unencrypt scrambled Sketchup extensions, and/or recovering the key used, violates Sketchup's terms of use and is not permitted.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'rbs_unscrambler'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rbs_unscrambler

## Usage

```
require 'rbs_unscrambler'
ruby_code = RbsUnscrambler.unscramble('file.rbs', 'LameSketchupPassword')
```
Note that in order for the above to work, you need to know the password Sketchup is using to scramble the files.
You 're on your own there, please dont contact me about that!
